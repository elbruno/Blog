{"Name":"Estimote SDK for iOS","Id":2186,"Alias":"estimotesdkios","Description":"So, you’ve heard about contextual computing, microlocation, beacons, and all that fancy stuff, and now you’ve arrived here to get to the bottom of it all. Cool, because this is the place where you’ll learn how to build a context-aware app with Estimote Beacons and Estimote SDK.\n\n## What is a beacon?\n\nEstimote Beacon is a small computer. Its 32-bit ARM® Cortex M0 CPU is accompanied by accelerometer, temperature sensor, and what is most important—2.4 GHz radio using Bluetooth 4.0 Smart, also known as BLE or Bluetooth low energy.\n\nThe greatest advantage of Bluetooth Smart over the previous iterations of BT technology is how energy efficient it is. Thanks to that, and to a lot of work our engineers put into power management, Estimote Beacons can last more than 3 years on default settings on a single CR2477 battery.\n\nDon’t confuse Bluetooth Smart with the first version of Bluetooth: the one that required pairing and never actually worked. It’s a new standard developed by Nokia™, now implemented in all modern smartphones like Apple iPhone™ or Samsung™ Galaxy S. Other devices, ranging from Fitbit fitness trackers to the Apple Watch, use Bluetooth Smart too.\n\nBluetooth SIG maintains a list of Bluetooth Smart devices.\n\n## Signal range and measuring proximity\n\nYou can think about the beacon as a small lighthouse. But instead of light, it uses radio waves, and instead of ships, it alerts smartphones of its presence. Estimote Beacons have a range of up to 70 meters (230 feet). The signal, however, can be diffracted, interfered with, or absorbed by water (including the human body). That’s why in real world conditions you should expect range of about 40–50 meters.\n\n\n\nPhones or other smart devices can pick up the beacon’s signal and estimate the distance by measuring received signal strength (RSSI). The closer you are to the beacon, the stronger the signal. Remember that the beacon is not broadcasting continuously—it’s blinking instead. The more frequent the blinks, the more reliable the signal detection.\n\nAnd because Bluetooth Smart doesn’t require pairing, a phone can listen to many beacons at the same time. This unlocks more opportunities: for example indoor location.\n\nTo understand how all this impacts your beacon-enabled app, read our primer on physics behind beacons.\n\n## What is iBeacon, nearables, Indoor Location SDK?\n\nBeacon is only a piece of hardware broadcasting radio signal. On top of that, there are different APIs, SDKs, and protocols that you’ll be using to bring microlocation to your apps. No worries though, we’ll explain all of that!\n\n - [What is iBeacon?](http://developer.estimote.com/documentation/ibeacon/overview.html)\n - [What is an Estimote Sticker? What are nearables?](http://developer.estimote.com/documentation/nearables/overview.html)\n - [What is Estimote Indoor Location SDK?](http://developer.estimote.com/documentation/indoor/overview.html)\n\n\n \n# Estimote SDK for iOS\n\nWe want the Estimote iOS SDK to be first choice when building any Estimote Beacons or Nearables related experience for the Apple iOS Platform. Our SDK provides a wide range of both utility and client facing features that will save time and make development easier than ever. It\u0027s built purely on Apple Core Location and Core Bluetooth technologies and is 100% iBeacon compatible.","Version":"3.7.0","Summary":"Estimote SDK for Xamarin.iOS to actively scan for Bluetooth Beacons, Nearables, and Eddystones.","QuickStart":"## Configuration\nIn your app’s AppDelegate on FinishedLaunching you can specify your Estimote app config:\n```csharp\nConfig.SetupAppID (“appId”, “appToken”);\n```\n\n**iOS8**\nYou must specify `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` or `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` in you info.plst file with a description that will be prompted to your users. Additionally, you must call the BeaconManager\u0027s `RequestAlwaysAuthorization` or `RequestWhenInUseAuthorization` methods. \n\n## iBeacons\n\nThe following code shows an example of how to use the `BeaconManager` to range for beacons.\n\n```csharp\nBeaconManager beaconManager;\nBeaconRegion region;\n\npublic async override void ViewDidLoad ()\n{\n\tbase.ViewDidLoad ();\n\tthis.Title = \"Select Beacon\";\n\tbeaconManager = new BeaconManager ();\n\tbeaconManager.ReturnAllRangedBeaconsAtOnce = true;\n\tvar uuid = new NSUuid (\"8492E75F-4FD6-469D-B132-043FE94921D8\");\n\tregion = new BeaconRegion (uuid, \"BeaconSample\");\n\tbeaconManager.StartRangingBeacons(region);\n\tbeaconManager.RangedBeacons += (sender, e) =\u003e \n\t{\n\t\tnew UIAlertView(\"Beacons Found\", \"Just found: \" + e.Beacons.Length + \" beacons.\", null, \"OK\").Show();\n\t};\n}\n```\n\n\n### Authorization\nYou can use the Estimote SDK for iOS to request authorization:\n\nYou can subscribe to authorazation changes on the BeaconManager:\n\n```csharp\nbeaconManager.AuthorizationStatusChanged += (sender, e) =\u003e \n{\n\tStartRangingBeacons();\n};\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can request authorization with:\n\n```\nprivate void StartRangingBeacons()\n{\n\tvar status = BeaconManager.AuthorizationStatus ();\n\tif (status == CLAuthorizationStatus.NotDetermined)\n\t{\n\t\tif (!UIDevice.CurrentDevice.CheckSystemVersion(8, 0)) {\n\n\t\t\tbeaconManager.StartRangingBeacons(region);\n\t\t} else {\n\n\t\t\tbeaconManager.RequestAlwaysAuthorization ();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\telse if(status == CLAuthorizationStatus.Authorized)\n\t{\n\t\tbeaconManager.StartRangingBeacons(region);\n\t}\n\telse if(status == CLAuthorizationStatus.Denied)\n\t{\n\t\tnew UIAlertView (\"Access Denied\", \"You have denied access to location services. Change this in app settings.\", null, \"OK\").Show ();\n\t}\n\telse if(status == CLAuthorizationStatus.Restricted)\n\t{\n\t\tnew UIAlertView (\"Location Not Available\", \"You have no access to location services.\", null, \"OK\").Show ();\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n\n\n## Nearables\nThe Estimote SDK for iOS can also be used with Estimote Stickers. Here is an example of using the `NearableManager` to range for wearables.\n\n**On iOS 8**\nYou must specify `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` or `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` in you info.plst file with a description that will be prompted to your users. \n\n```csharp\nNearableManager manager;\npublic override void ViewDidLoad ()\n{\n\tbase.ViewDidLoad ();\n\n\tTableView.WeakDataSource = this;\n\tTableView.WeakDelegate = this;\n\n\tmanager = new NearableManager ();\n\n\tmanager.RangedNearables += (sender, e) =\u003e \n\t{\n\t\tnew UIAlertView(\"Nearables Found\", \"Just found: \" + e.Nearables.Length + \" nearables.\", null, \"OK\").Show();\n\t};\n\n\tmanager.StartRanging (NearableType.All);\n}\n\n```\n","Hash":"65cc92e4cbe590eae53457594f02b3da","TargetPlatforms":["ios"],"TrialHash":null}
